One simple Android game that will generate random 6 numbers from 1 to 9, these numbers will appear in random places, and the user has to touch the numbers (or push buttons) from the smallest to the greater for the shortest possible time!

It is currently functional, but it's not finished as I had in plan to add more levels and to change the game mode(having the possibility to play with time, ex. 5sec. remaining to end the game and getting involed with the animations so one figure(as BONUSE) will be appeared and if user touched it he will earn extra time(as initial point, +5seconds and later on to think about coins) and to enhance the Graphic/UI/UX of the game!
